# Freespace Webservice

This is the data service application for [Freespace](https://github.com/calvin-cs262-fall2020-Freespace/Project).

The database is relational and hosted on elephantsql.com. The database user
and password are stored as Heroku configuration variables.

We implement this as a separate repo to simplify Heroku integration.
